This is the workspace in which the simulation for the mine detection bot will be carried out

Changes made in this commit:
    Random placement of 2 mines has been done
    the bot is moving properly with 4WD, just gotta create links so that it publishes something to tf

The models, and textures in the minefield_sim/models, and the minefield_sim/media don't work unless you copy those folders to /usr/share/gazebo-9/

Do that if you don't want any errors
